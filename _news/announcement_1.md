Just completed a 5-week intensive [Science to data science (S2DS)]( https://www.s2ds.org/) bootcamp :sparkles: :smile:. 
Alongside four data scientists, we developed an automatic computer vison tool to calculate the properties of welds from images for the [Electrical Power Research institute](https://www.epri.com/).
