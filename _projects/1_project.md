I am currently working on a Leverhulme funded project on [glacier melting and water security in Central Asia]( https://centralasiawater.blog/). 
The aim of the project is to improve estimates of the timing of **peak water** in the Syr Darya river in Central Asia. For this purpose, I have added a degree day snow and glacier melt model into the Dynamic fluxEs and ConnectIvity for Predictions of HydRology ([DECIPHeR](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/2285/2019/)) model. The Naryn catchment in Kyrgyzstan, a tributary of the Syr Darya, is used as a case study to evaluate the model.

    Left: Upper part of the Naryn catchment, Kyrgyzstan. The river path calculated by the DECIPHeR model is shown in black. Glacier thicknesses for the 1970s are calculated using the GlabTop2 method and Landsat derived glacier outlines. Right: Distribution of hydrological response units showing the model can downscale the climate to a high resolution.
