I am currently (December 2022) archiving my code on GitHub at repository [ClimateDataLab](https://github.com/ClimateDataLab).

Below are past projects I have worked on.  
<br />
Developed a degree day snow and glacier melt model for the Dynamic fluxEs and ConnectIvity for Predictions of HydRology DECIPHeR. 
The model description is published in [HESS](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/27/453/2023/) and the code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sarahshannon/DECIPHeR-glacier)

Co-developed an elevation dependent surface mass balance scheme for the [JULES](https://jules.jchmr.org/) land surface model. The code is hosted on the Met Office Shared Repository.

Developed a dust cycle model for my PhD using the [Lund-Potsdam-Jena DGVM](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/departments/activities/biosphere-water-modelling/lpjml) to calculate time evolving dust sources areas. I calculated dust emissions using a model of saltation and sandblasting. Dust was transported using the [TOMCAT](http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~lecmc/tomcat.html) chemical transport model, into which I added a dry and wet deposition removal scheme.
