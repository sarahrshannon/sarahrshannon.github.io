I am a climate scientist based at the University of Bristol, specialising in the prediction of climate change impacts on water resources in glacier and snow-fed catchments. My research also involves developing models to accurately forecast future sea-level rise resulting from melting glaciers and ice sheets. 

My work centres around three core themes: first, I write code to model physical processes; second, I calibrate and validate models against historical observations, including remote sensing datasets; and finally, I run multi-model projections to predict the impacts of climate change under various CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation scenarios.

My research journey began as an atmospheric scientist, where I developed a desert dust model to explain high concentrations of Saharan dust observed in Barbados during the 1980s. More recently, I have focused on assessing the links between climate change and glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in Peru and Chile. 

I am currently interested in working at the intersection between climate change and AI.
