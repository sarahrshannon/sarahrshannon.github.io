I am a climate scientist at Ember, a clean energy think tank, where I use remote sensing data to monitor methane emissions from coal mines. My background lies in developing climate and hydrological models. 
In the past, I have:

- Developed a snow and glacier melt model for the DECIPHeR hydrology model, predicting the impacts of glacier melting on river flows in Central Asian catchments.
- Created a glacier model for the JULES land surface model, using it to predict future sea level rise.
- Began as an atmospheric scientist, developing a desert dust model to explain the high concentrations of Saharan dust observed in Barbados during the 1980s.
- Recently focused on using computer vision techniques to identify features in photographic and satellite imagery.

I am excited about emerging technologies in earth observation and artificial intelligence.
