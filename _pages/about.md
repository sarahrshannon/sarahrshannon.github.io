I am a climate scientist based at the University of Bristol. My research focuses on modelling the impacts of climate change on water availability in glaciated catchments in Central Asia. I also model future sea-level rise from melting glaciers and ice sheets.

I started research as an atmospheric scientist, developing a model to predict the emissions, transport and removal of dust aerosol in the atmosphere. More recently, my research has focused on assessing the risk of glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in Peru and Chile.
