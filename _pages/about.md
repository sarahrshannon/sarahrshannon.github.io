I am a **climate scientist** at the University of Bristol with a diverse range of research interests. I am passionate about making climate data relevant and usable. 

We have reached a political tipping point in efforts to solve the climate problem. At COP26 it was recognised that, to keep the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius warming alive, requires greater action on mitigation and immediate concrete steps to reduce global emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. 

To meet this goal, organisations need useful climate data to assess their expose to climate risk so they can implement mitigation strategies.  Scientists have generated terabytes of climate modelling data, which in its raw form is often complex to interpret and difficult to use. Accessing and interpreting this information is a key part of achieving the COP26 target.
