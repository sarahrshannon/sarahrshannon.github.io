I am a **climate scientist** at the University of Bristol with a diverse range of research interests; modelling streamflow in glaciated river catchments, sea-level rise predictions from glacier and ice sheets and modelling atmospheric desert dust. 

I am passionate about making climate data relevant and usable. Scientists have generated terabytes of climate modelling data, which in its raw form is often complex to interpret and difficult to use. My interests are in translating this information and making it accessible.
