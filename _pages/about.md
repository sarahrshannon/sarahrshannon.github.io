I am a **climate scientist** at the University of Bristol. I have a diverse range of research interests; modelling streamflow in glaciated river catchments, sea-level rise predictions from glacier and ice sheets and modelling atmospheric desert dust. 

I am interested in making climate data relevant and usable. I also love writing code!
