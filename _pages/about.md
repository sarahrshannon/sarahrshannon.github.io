I am a climate scientist based at the University of Bristol. My research focuses on developing software to predict how climate change will impact future water availability in glacier and snow-fed catchments in Central Asia. I also develop models to predict sea-level rise from melting glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet.     

I started research as an atmospheric scientist. For my PhD I developed a model to predict the emission and transport of desert dust in the atmosphere. More recently, my research has focused on assessing the risk of glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in Peru and Chile.
