A **climate scientist**, with a track record of research in academia across a diverse range of disciplines. Motivated to make climate data interpretable and accessible. 

We have reached a political tipping point in efforts to solve the climate problem. At COP26 it was recognised that, to keep the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius warming alive, requires greater action on mitigation and immediate concrete steps to reduce global emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. This ambitious target means that organisations need to assess their expose to climate risk in order to implement mitigation strategies.   

Scientists have generated terabytes of climate modelling data, which in its raw form is often complex to interpret and difficult to use. I can help simplify and translate this data into climate information that is relevant and understandable.
