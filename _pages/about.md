I am a climate scientist based at the University of Bristol. My research focuses on modelling the impacts of climate change on water resources in glaciated catchments in Central Asia. I also model future sea-level rise from melting glaciers and ice sheets. 
Three common themes underpin my work: 1) writing code to model physical processes 2) calibration and validation of models against past observations, for example remote sensing datasets and 3) running multi-model projections to predict the impacts of climate change under different CO<sub>2</sub> mitigation scenarios.  

I started research as an atmospheric scientist, developing a desert dust model to understand the reasons for high Saharan dust concentrations observed at Barbados during the 1980s. 
More recently, my research has focused on assessing the links between climate change and glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in Peru and Chile.
